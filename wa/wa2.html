      <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>In this course, I am hoping that I will be able to porduce a website of my own after being done with the course to use for things such as job applications and a place to store my projects and art work.</p>
      <h4>About Me!</h4>
        <p>I am a business major studying finance and marketing and will graduate this May. I was born and raised in Denver, CO and have not been able to leave this beautiful place I call home.<p/>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy working out, skiing, snowboarding, painting, and spending time with family and friends. I am a huge Nuggets fan and love to go to games with my family. I also have two dogs, Miles and Max who are a little bit crazy, but never fail to keep us entertained!</p>
